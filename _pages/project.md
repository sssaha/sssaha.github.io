## Research Projects
### Blockchain for Transactive Energy 
This project implements Blockchain technology to both secure and facilitate energy trading between DERs for Transactive Energy platform. Hyperledger Fabric is implemented onto a secure hardware chip developed by project partner ["BlockFrame"](http://www.blockframetech.com/) that sets immutable cryptographic keys for each DER asset. The underlying keys and associated Blockchain capabilities allow for proof-of-origin and proof-of-trust verification. 

### Synthetic Power Distribution Network
In this project, I created a framework to generate synthetic power distribution networks. These networks map to real geo-spatial topologies that track roads from OpenStreetMap data. Substation locations were selected from similar work that developed synthetic transmission test cases. Underlying real and reactive power in the distribution network were assigned using population information gathered from United States 2010 Census block data.

### JAVA Based Transient Simulator Development
Currently working on developing a JAVA based transient stability simulator using [OpenPA](https://github.com/powerdata/com.powerdata.openpa) library; which will then be included in the long term dynamic stability simulator developed by the industry partners. This work also includes the development an unbalanced power flow algorithm to be added to the OpenPA library.

### Design of an Universal Charge Controller
The goal of the this project was to design an Universal Charge Controller (UCC) that meets load requirements for a household or other small building up to 500W peak load capacity. Power source connections include solar photovoltaics (18-24VDC), battery storage (12-24VDC), an AC micro-grid (110/220VAC), or a DC micro-grid (50-70VDC). This flexibility, combined with intelligent controls, permits the UCC to serve as the keystone in connecting various energy architectures as a community develops over time. 

### Analysis of off-grid microgrid design for Niger
I developed a Python based tool that converts QGIS models of eleven islanded villages of Niger for [PowerGen](https://www.powergen-renewable-energy.com/). The automated tool can refine the QGIS based distribution network models and can produce a GIS visualiztion of the network voltage.
