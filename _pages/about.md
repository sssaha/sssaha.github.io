"It is not our ability that shows what we really are; it is our choices"- this quote from the Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets has always inspired me to step out from my comfort zone and face challenges. These challenges provide me a strong personal drive for academic research, commercialization, philanthropy, and education and instruction.

After finishing my undergrad from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) of [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) back in 2014, I decided to pursue the hardest path of the academic research i.e., decided to join a Ph.D. program. I decided to join [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Nathan Johnson](https://sustainability.asu.edu/person/nathan-johnson/){:target="_blank"} for [Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions (LEAPS)](https://leaps.asu.edu/) during Fall 2015. 

Joining the Ph. D. program helped me expand my skills in different commercial software and various programming languages. I got opportunities to directly with our industry partners like Incsys, XENDEE, and academic partners like LBNL. Moreover, I am the student member of the IEEE Smart Village Technology Committee, where I am in charge of developing an open-source universal charge controller for off-grid areas. I am currently focusing on **synthetic distribution feeder development, application of blockchain in Transactive Energy, and cyber-security of inverter-dominated networks**. On June 21st, 2021, I defended my PhD dissertation titled, "Stability and Security of Distribution Networks with High Penetration Renewables."

I have always been a team player and like working with a different group of people. I enjoy being a leader. I am passionate about affordably developing advanced technology solutions to help humanity as well as the industry.

Some personal information I'd like to share about myself:
- I am addicted to Chess and International Bridge. Please find me (**sssaha**) at [BridgeBase](https://www.bridgebase.com/){:target="_blank"} if you are interested in playing together.
- I like traveling, cooking, binge-watching tv shows. My personal favorite is and probably will always be [Person of Interest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/).
