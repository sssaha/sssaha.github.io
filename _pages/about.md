Hi! I'm Samrat ('Sam'). I am originally from Bangladesh. Here are some personal information I'd like to share about myself:
- I'd like to describe myself as an ambivert and adaptable guy who likes to plan ahead. 
- I love football. And, by football I mean 'Soccer'. Huge fan of Manchester United. GGMU.
- I like travelling, cooking, binge-watching tv shows & animes, listening to melody songs.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://electrical-engineering.uark.edu/) at the [University of Arkansas, Fayetteville](http://www.uark.edu/)(UofA) and serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Intelligent Information Sensing and Transmission Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Jingxian Wu](https://wuj.hosted.uark.edu/). My research focus is on developing sequential analysis based optimization algorithms with applications in various fields of electrical engineering. Currently, I'm working on my dissertation titled "Quickest Change Detection with Imperfect Post-change Models" with the target of graduating in May 2020.

I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) of [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/). During my senior year, I worked on "Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction Scheme for Human Action Recognition" in my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah](https://sites.google.com/site/drshaikhfattah/). After my undergrad, I came to USA in Spring 2016 to pursue my doctoral studies at the UofA. I had the opportunity to work on different kinds of projects during last 4 years. My research studies deal with Optimization, Machine Learning, Seuqntial Analysis, Statistical Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, Pattern Recognition among many other topics. For now, my goal is to have a stimulating research-centric career concentrated on data science and algorithm development. 

In this site, I've shared my academic and research experiences. Thanks for visiting my site!
