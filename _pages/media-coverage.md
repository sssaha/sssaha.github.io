### Training Program
I have always enjoyed teaching and training people, and joining my lab provided me an incredible opportunity through the Microgrid Boot Camp (Details can be found [here](https://leaps.asu.edu/trainings/)). Since 2016, I have been part of the team responsible for content preparation, hardware integration test and software training program. I have been conducting the training session on XENDEE for 'Microgrid Design and Operation'. Glimpse of microgrid boot camps can be found in the following videos:
